# Tests as executable protocol commentary

The strongest claims in this book have executable counterparts.
[`tests/rfc_conformance.rs`](https://github.com/querygraph/rgbdns/blob/master/tests/rfc_conformance.rs) names normative
requirements and constructs exact packets. [`tests/wire_security.rs`](https://github.com/querygraph/rgbdns/blob/master/tests/wire_security.rs)
contains a hostile corpus and checks every truncation of a structured packet.
[`tests/packet_properties.rs`](https://github.com/querygraph/rgbdns/blob/master/tests/packet_properties.rs) generates
arbitrary bytes and structured messages:

```rust
#[test]
fn arbitrary_packets_never_panic(
    bytes in prop::collection::vec(any::<u8>(), 0..4096)
) {
    let _ = Message::decode(&bytes);
}
```

The property suite does not prove that every accepted DNS packet has the
desired meaning. It establishes three valuable invariants over a large input
space: decoding never panics, accepted packets can be re-encoded and reparsed,
and generated structured messages round-trip without semantic loss.

Golden CDB fixtures protect historical compatibility. Live UDP/TCP tests
exercise connection reuse and framing. `drill` provides an independent
encoder and decoder. The stable-Rust benchmark in
[`benches/dns_core.rs`](https://github.com/querygraph/rgbdns/blob/master/benches/dns_core.rs) measures the functions that
rgbdns itself owns, and [`docs/performance.md`](https://github.com/querygraph/rgbdns/blob/master/docs/performance.md) records both
timings and wire size.

This is where Rust most clearly changes the economics of a C rewrite. Memory
safety removes many failure modes before testing. Property tests can then
spend their budget on protocol structure rather than rediscovering use-after-
free and buffer-overrun variants. The remaining failures are more likely to be
interesting DNS mistakes.

## Generated Code Fragment Index

Each card names an rgbdns fragment. In FirstPair Reader, Show code lists its numbered lines and Open file opens the collocated code note with those lines marked.
